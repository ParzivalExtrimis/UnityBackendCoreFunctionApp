A powerful and robust solution to manage users, institutions and provide a scalable and balanced storage pipeline powered by Azure. Allowing for the ease of having an out-of-the-box backend for large streamable files that need to delievered with minimized load on the host machine. Also provides state management for processes, as well as for active users.

Note: The Authentication API written in ASP.NET will be replaced with a newer API based on .NET Core with improved efficiency and chnages to identity models based on the newer requirements. Thus the registration endpoint does exist but impractical to use as of now until the newer API is online and a way for the institutional control to enable content for any user has also been setup. Hence, you can use the prexisting users for now. From the example below.

### [Optional]

   If you however, still want to use the older depricated version. You can use this endpoint for [registrations](https://unitybackend20230212174016.azurewebsites.net/Help/Api/POST-api-Account-Register) But you would have to manually the item to your content catalog ( Your cosmos db environment ) which should be in a format that looks somthing like this,
    
```json
{
    "id": "wevrf322v5",
    "batch": "10A",
    "grade": "10",
    "school": "HBO",
    "subjects": [
        "Math"
    ],
    "chapters": [
        "Shapes1"
    ],
    "content": [
        "spherescene-Android"
    ],
    "_rid": "zJt7AJNWzt0DAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "_self": "dbs/zJt7AA==/colls/zJt7AJNWzt0=/docs/zJt7AJNWzt0DAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "_etag": "\"0200ab26-0000-2000-0000-640f4ebd0000\"",

}
```

## Getting Started

There are two main branches that are designed for testing on typical dev environments and preferences.

Note: If you do not have an Azure account then you can use  [Azurite with an HTTPS endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio#authorization-for-tools-and-sdks) to emulate
a storage account and a [CosmosDB Emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21) as an alternative. 
    If you want to use connection strings use the method below or if you want to use managed identities you can follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial) to set that up for yourself. For developmenet purposes I would suggest
using connection strings.

    Azure Development environment: Here it is assumed that you have access
        to an Azure account along with a storage account and a cosmos DB account
        ( any configuration should work ) but I have chosed a general purpose v2 
        for storage and default dedicated plan for cosmos. With that here's how
        to get started

            1. Clone the project into Visual Studio ( the simplest way as there is
               a .sln file included )
            2. Add a local.settings.json file to the root project directory which 
                should look something like this:

```json
        {
            "IsEncrypted": false,
            "Values": {
                "AzureWebJobsStorage" : "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
                "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
                "CosmosDBConnection": "AccountEndpoint=https://<your-cosmos>.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=<your-key>;"
            },
            "ConnectionStrings": {
                "CloudStorageAccount": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your-storage>;AccountKey=<your-key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
                "CosmosDBConnection": "<same-as-the-other-cosmos>"
            }
        }
 ```
           3. Replace the above slots with your own connection strings and your good to 
              go. Just make sure to tun dotnet restore on the project to resolve dependencies.
              Build and run.
           4. You should have a console output with a link to a locally hosted endpoint to
              initiate the process.  
           5. Send a post request to the link with a json body attatched like in the
              example below


## Example

![PostmanLocalRequest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72618565/225881260-1ea7f29f-8a5c-44b3-baee-bfee3c5bfdaf.png)

Make sure to set Content-type to application/json in your headers

### You can Skip all of this and directly test the hosted app like this:

![vrBackendPostmanRemote](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72618565/225882719-600286fd-f1ec-45a8-89fe-730182fe49b8.png)

The only problem here is that the pipeline endpoint that is required to read from the user's temp container where the content is stored during the session is still in development. You will be able test it soon as it goes into release.

## Output

The request you made should return the state manager for the process, something like this

![functionsOutput](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72618565/226097042-e0762902-b8d6-4e0d-81c3-d25caf339c0f.png)

If you made all the connections perfectly then following the statusQueryUrl. Should give you this when completed. If it is still proessing it 
return a status "runnning". Else, you will probably see the output field with an error thrown.
